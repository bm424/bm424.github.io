Today we publish. The plan is to use GitHub pages, which at first glance seemed
pretty simple but none of the documentation immediately points to hwo to run
the repo through a build process before publication. So finding that out is
the immediate priority.

Half an hour in and this is not nearly as easy as I expected. It seems these
custom builds just aren't really a part of the GitHub ecosystem and... I get
that... but I really think it ought to be achievable with GitHub actions.
