        <h1>commit</h1>
<p>Today we publish. The plan is to use GitHub pages, which at first glance seemed
pretty simple but none of the documentation immediately points to hwo to run
the repo through a build process before publication. So finding that out is
the immediate priority.</p>
<hr />
<p>Half an hour in and this is not nearly as easy as I expected. It seems these
custom builds just aren't really a part of the GitHub ecosystem and... I get
that... but I really think it ought to be achievable with GitHub actions.</p>
<h1>tag</h1>
<p>And another half an hour later and we're live at <a href="https://bm424.github.io/">bm424.github.io</a>!
Turned out to be not that difficult, just a heavy reliance on existing published
actions, which isn't something I'm very used to.</p>
<p>I'm going to write down what happened for my own future reference.</p>
<h2>Self-Tutorial</h2>
<p>There are three basic steps needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checkout your own repository. This is accomplished using the public
   "checkout" action, visitable <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">here</a>.
   This is surprising to me, as I'd have assumed this was more or less an
   automatic part of the process, but I suppose explicitly doing this is better
   than implicitly assuming it.</li>
<li>Create a version of your <em>own</em> build action. This was actually pretty
   simple, you can directly reference your own Docker image and the entire
   source repo is mounted in, so as long as you're using relative file names
   (normally a sad accident, but here a happy one) it pretty much successfully
   built first time, although I was a little confused about where the action
   was supposed to live (turns out top-level in the repo is fine).</li>
<li>Use yet another public image, this one sourced from a nice little tutorial
   <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-host-your-static-webpages-on-github-pages">here</a>,
   to push the site to your branch. A quick skim through the source code
   suggests this does much of the same manual stuff one might have implemented
   (git push to branch etc) but packaged up nice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward, I'm hoping I'll remember to refer to this repo as a canonical
example for myself.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

        <h1>print()</h1>
<p>So, main changes today include adding support for each posts's metadata,
handling multiple posts building to the same page in the correct order,
and some small updates to improve the site's aesthetics including some
page hierarchy and correct scaling on mobile.</p>
<p>One of the things I find it's really important to do, particularly in personal
projects, is write a few notes to yourself to remind you simply what commands
to write to get things working again. It sounds obvious, but a lot of the actual
minutes spent on a programming project for me are spent working out the correct
order of operations.</p>
<p>For this project, the relevant command is a simple
<code>docker-compose build &amp;&amp; docker-compose run main</code>
but in a web project with multiple moving parts these kinds of crucial lines
can be easy to forget or get lost in a maze of possible, often redundant (in
the sense of overlapping functionality) scripts. So when I write a README file,
it's as much for me as for anyone else who might pick up the project.</p>
<h1>.split()</h1>
<p>One thing that came up while coding today was the issue of post permalinks.
I'm not even going to <em>attempt</em> to go there. The quick solution I settled on
was to link to the posts using the file name. As I anticipate I'll be changing
those much less than the titles of the posts, they ought to be permanent enough,
and they map to the titles sufficiently closely to be sensible in the URL.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this may be similar to what professional static site
generators do, given the mismatch between URLs and post titles that I sometimes
see.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, using a NamedTuple was a good way to pass values into
the Jinja templates quickly, but it's quickly showing its limitations. I've
been using Pydantic a lot at work and I like it a lot, we'll see if I need to
get it involved here, depending on how much the complexity of the NamedTuple
structure increases.</p>
<h1>:focus</h1>
<p>To wrap up, I spent a fair bit of time faffing around with the style of the
anchor links to the posts. This is actually the kind of thing I tend to find
really fun, because webpage style is one of the ways it's easy to get a little
creative in projects like this. That said, I often get carried away in style
over substance. Part of this project is to focus on getting the content out,
rather than perfecting style, so with these final changes I'm going to call
it a day and implement the GitHub pages build another time.</p>

        <h1>import</h1>
<p>A couple of hours later and we have a working static site builder running
locally using Docker, Python, Jinja2, markdown, and not much else. On the
whole I'm pretty happy with the timing, particularly considering a fairly
significant chunk of that was actually writing the build day 0 content.</p>
<p>I initially thought I'd be needing a running server to see changes live, but
quickly realised that was going to be unnecessary - the Docker rebuild was
more than quick enough to get a fast feedback loop going, and the most
fiddly bit, the CSS, I could actually just do in the build styles, refreshing
the page in the meantime, then copy back into the source when done.</p>
<h1>next()</h1>
<p>Simple enough so far. However, having now added this next file, I need to make
a couple of changes to ensure one can navigate to past entries, and then it
should be a simple case of deploying to GitHub pages.</p>
<p>I say that. I've done it before, but quite a long time ago (my company uses
GitLab, so I'm a little out of practice)... so see you in the next entry.</p>
<h1>wraps()</h1>
<p>I've slightly backdated this post because these reflections were based on the
hour or two of work I did after writing the first day's post a couple of days
ago, and I want to spend a bit of time after today (2021-05-26) reflecting
on today's work instead. Just for transparency's sake...</p>

<p>All projects begin somewhere, and this is where this one begins.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be building a personal
portfolio/showcase of code projects, each chosen for both personal interest
and to demonstrate my use of particular technologies, such as the web stack,
machine learning, or programming interface development.</p>
<h1>__doc__</h1>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, firstly, a lot of the code I write is for the company I work for,
and so while the things I can do has expanded significantly over the last few
years, none of it is particularly reflected in my GitHub profile, and I'd like
to bring that up to date.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to create a coding space for myself that is less restricted
by deadlines and "product" pressure, to try and focus on best practices,
and to exercise older programming skills I used to use regularly (such as
in training neural networks).</p>
<p>And lastly, I think the projects I've lined up are going to be a lot of fun,
and by tackling some of them I hope I can rekindle my enthusiasm for hobbyist
programming.</p>
<h1>__call__</h1>
<p>So what are these projects to be? In order of increasing complexity:</p>
<ol>
<li>This! A simple static site generator, from scratch, written in Python and
   markdown, where I can record my progress and thoughts on each project
   as I go.</li>
<li>A bit of a personal exercise, writing a simple Schr√∂dinger equation
   solver in Python, with graphical output. If it goes well, I'll convert
   it into a web app.</li>
<li>A dinosaur family tree/cladogram, implemented as a web app using React
   and/or Redux, interactive, searchable, and live on the web.</li>
<li>A board game, called Bao, which I learned as a kid on holiday in Zanzibar,
   implemented in Rust using Bevy.</li>
<li>An open street map tile neural network tile generator, implemented in
   Python and, if all goes well, deployed as a web app.</li>
</ol>
<h1>__exit__</h1>
<p>This particular post was written before any code, and represents simply
the starting point for project 1. Next post, I'll be writing up reflections
on the implementation of this little custom static site generator. If you've
read this far, thanks! And see you next time.</p>
