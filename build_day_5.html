<p>So; after deciding that the full dinosaur family tree might be a little too ambitious for a showcase React project, I've brought myself back down to earth with something still challenging but manageable, and it's something I've wanted to tackle for a little while: an itenerary planner.</p>
<p>Here's the basic idea: when I go for a long trip, especially one overseas or involving multiple stops, I normally start to piece things together in a spreadsheet detailing the start, end, type of journey being made, and so on at each stage of the trip.
Often there are files or links associated with each stage that I'd also like to link, like PDFs of train tickets, Visas, or whatever.
However, there's often a lot of manual shuffling and rewriting for this kind of work - say I want to introduce an intermediate stop or two and I have to rearrange the origin and destination of the surrounding stops.
That's a pain and adds an element of tedium to the planning process.
It'd be nice to have a little app that did all that for me, without going into the complexities of apps like AirBnB or DesignMyNight or whatever that have a lot of connections going in (and out).
I just want to plan my trip, my way.</p>
<p>Now, in all honesty, it's unlikely that I can put something together here that will actually become <em>the</em> itinerary planner going forward.
There's a lot to be said for the flexibility of, say, a spreadsheet (or, it occurs to me, a Notion doc).
However, there are some really nice interactive components we can build here and as a project it's a pretty solid one, that I'm guessing visitors (hey, you!) can relate to, even if it's not something you (or I) are actually likely to use.</p>
<p>I'll probably next write when I've got a working prototype, because for now the whole thing is very much in the set-up phase.
Until then.</p>
